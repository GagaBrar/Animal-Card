			<p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies from light buff to silvery grey, to yellowish red and dark brown. The underparts are generally lighter, and cubs are born with dark spots on their bodies. The spots fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts</p>
